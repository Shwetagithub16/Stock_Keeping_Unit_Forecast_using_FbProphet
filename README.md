**Business understanding:** “Global Mart” is an online store super giant having worldwide operations. It takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate & home office.

**Objective:** Presently, we oversee 15 distinct product sub-categories, and our goal is to predict the quantities for each of these subcategories over the upcoming three months.

**Understanding the Data:** Presently, the dataset comprises transactional data, with each row denoting a specific order conducted on the online store. Within each transaction, there exist 24 attributes. The "Market" attribute encompasses 7 distinct factor levels, denoting the geographical market sector to which the customer is affiliated. Additionally, the "Segment" attribute indicates the customer's membership in one of the 3 segments. For a comprehensive list of attributes, please refer to the dataset's complete data dictionary, accessible through the provided link.

**Modeling Approach:** Within the realm of forecasting, there exist diverse time series models at our disposal. Initially, we will delve into comprehending the inherent trends and seasonal patterns within the data. Subsequently, through meticulous feature engineering, we will pinpoint the most effective attributes to model the series. This process will culminate in predicting the series values using the selected model, while simultaneously generating a new series derived from the disparity between the original and predicted series. The residual series resultant from this procedure should ideally approximate random noise. To execute this, we will leverage a widely recognized library known as "Prophet," developed by Facebook. Notably, "Prophet" has demonstrated its efficacy specifically in the domain of Demand Forecasting, which aligns seamlessly with our present use case.

**Model Assessment:** Following the development of a model that meets our criteria, the subsequent phase involves predicting the product quantities for the upcoming three months using this established model. To gauge the precision of these forecasts, an initial course of action entails segregating the final three months' values from the dataset. This segregation occurs post the aggregation of transaction-level data into monthly data points. Subsequently, we evaluate the three-month forecast accuracy by comparing it against the out-of-sample data points. For this assessment, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) stands as the chosen parameter for quantifying the forecast performance.
